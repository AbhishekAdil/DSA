# DSA
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Python.

It includes well-structured code examples and explanations for common data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (such as sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and more).

kindly read the comments and notes shared for better understanding of the codes.
